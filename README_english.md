<h1 align="center">Goal</h1>
   <p>The goal of this project was to generate the respective QR Code from the url sent by the user. For the elaboration of this project, html, pure css and Javascript were used; I opted to make use of an API/CDN in order to increase page loading speed and, thinking about future contexts, the advantage of being able to withstand intense traffic.<br></br>The API provided that it was created the chart and later the inclusion of the same, in addition, it has a <b>specific parameter</b> for the creation of QR Code type charts.</p>
